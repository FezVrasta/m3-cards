// Jinja2 in a card's own config, for every card at once.
//
// A card binds its name, icon or colour to an entity's state, and that is all it
// can do: "Kitchen", or the raw value — never "Kitchen · 21.4 °C", and never an
// icon that depends on two entities at once. Mushroom's template card can do
// that, so a dashboard moved over from mushroom loses it, and the workaround is
// a template-sensor helper in the Home Assistant config for every card that
// needs one.
//
// A card mixed with this gets it without knowing. Any string in its config
// containing `{{` or `{%` is subscribed over Home Assistant's `render_template`
// websocket subscription — the same live subscription the nav card already uses
// for its entries — and substituted before the card renders. Which strings
// those are is up to whoever wrote the dashboard: the mixin has no list of
// fields, so anything a card reads out of its config can be templated.
//
// HOW IT ATTACHES
//
// Not by wrapping `setConfig`. Every card does real work in there — building
// nested cards, pulling the entity registry over the websocket, reading
// collapse state — and running all of it again just to get a new string in
// would make a templated name cost as much as a dashboard reload. So the mixin
// hooks `willUpdate`, which runs before every render, and swaps `_config` for a
// resolved copy at that point. setConfig runs once per config, as before; a
// pushed value costs one substitution and one render.
//
// Cards need no change of their own beyond mixing this in: they go on reading
// `this._config`, which is now the config they were given with the templates
// already rendered.
//
// A card whose config holds no template pays one small object per instance and
// two identity comparisons per update, and nothing else: no subscription, no
// manager, no copy of the config, no extra render. Its `_config` stays the very
// object its own setConfig built.

// The `any[]` rest parameter is what TypeScript requires of a mixin's base
// constructor; nothing here reads the arguments.

/**
 * The two members the mixin reaches for on the card.
 *
 * Both are declared by the cards themselves — `_config` as a private `@state()`
 * and `hass` as a plain property on most cards but as an accessor pair on a
 * couple of them — and re-declaring either here would clash with those
 * declarations rather than unify with them. One cast, in one place, is the
 * honest way to state what the mixin expects of its host: the config in
 * `_config`, Home Assistant in `hass`.
