// Central design-token scale for every M3 card. const.ts's per-card constants
// (e.g. BATTERY_ROW_HEIGHT, COST_CHIP_RADIUS) derive their values from here,
// so the numbers behind "a row is 52px tall" or "a chip has 15px radius"
// live in exactly one place. Card files keep importing the per-card names
// from const.ts as before — this file is the single source of truth behind
// those names, not a replacement import surface.
//
// Where cards genuinely need a different number (e.g. the climate card's
// larger 32px hero radius, or the battery card's taller two-line row), that
// deviation is intentional and documented at the const.ts call site, not
// silently forced onto this scale.

  // cards, which use `cardHero`/`cardMini` for their larger hero shape.

  // with. Converges on a ~0.365 radius-to-box ratio across every card that
  // was built with a squircle icon.
  squircle56: 20, // hero header icon (56px box) — weather/media
  squircle44: 16, // header icon-swatch (44px box)
  squircle52: 19, // "hero" main icon (52px box) — cost/summary
  squircle32: 12, // list-row icon (32px box) — top-consumers/battery
  squircle30: 11, // list-row icon (30px box) — power-list/cost-tariff

// consumed as a CSS value, not a plain number; durations are grouped here.

// here for new cards to match, not mechanically wired into existing inline
// CSS templates (which would churn a lot of diff for zero behavior change).

  rowValue: { size: 14, weight: 700 },
} as const;

// ---- Color palette ----------------------------------------------------------
// Canonical hex values for the M3 mode/domain palette. THEME_COLOR_TOKENS
// (const.ts) covers free-form HA color names for user overrides; this is the
// project's own default palette used when a card falls back to its built-in
// accent rather than a user override.
