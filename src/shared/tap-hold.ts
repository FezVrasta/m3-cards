// Tap / hold / double-tap on one element, told apart from each other and from a
// drag.
//
// The button card has carried its own copy of this since it was the only card
// that needed it, and `shared/actions.ts` says out loud that the next card to
// need the same thing should not write a third one. This is that module. It is
// written fresh rather than lifted out of the button card, because the button
// card's copy is entangled with its slider drag and its icon's second set of
// actions — and because that card is the most-used in the suite and not worth
// destabilising for a refactor it does not benefit from today. It can adopt this
// whenever it is next touched; the timings here are its own, so the behaviour
// would not change.
//
// Why the double-tap delay is conditional: waiting to see whether a second tap
// arrives makes every single tap feel late. So the wait only happens when a
// double-tap action actually exists — the common case, where it does not, fires
// on the first tap with no delay at all.
