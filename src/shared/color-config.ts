// accent that reads well as a fill is washed out as a figure or a label. Each
// entry comes back with a `-fg` suffix, adjusted only as far as the target
// contrast demands and left alone when it already clears it, which means the
// dark theme is untouched.
//
// Deliberately explicit rather than derived from variable names: a card's
// foreground colours are not all called "-accent" (power-summary alone has
// `ps-main` and `ps-producer`), and guessing from names would silently miss

// the theme sets nothing — every value is passed through unchanged, so the

 * non-highlighted rows tint from `var(--primary-text-color)`, so the tint fell
