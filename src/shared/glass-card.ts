// The frosted-glass surface, as one value so the three cards that build their
// own card CSS (button, climate, climate-mini) cannot drift from it.
//
// Mixed from the card *surface* colour, not the text colour. HA already hands
// every card theme-correct variables — the surface is light in a light theme
// and dark in a dark one — so tinting with it is self-correcting and needs no
// theme detection. Tinting with the text colour, as this did before, inverts
// that: in a light theme it darkened the backdrop that dark text then had to
// sit on, which made every card unreadable over a dark dashboard wallpaper.
//
// 55% keeps the backdrop visible through the blur while still establishing a
// ground of its own, so legibility no longer depends on what is behind the
// dashboard — something the card cannot see.
